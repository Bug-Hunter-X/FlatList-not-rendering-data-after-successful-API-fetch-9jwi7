# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API fetch.  The provided code fetches data from a public API, but the FlatList remains empty.

## Problem

The `DataFetch` component correctly fetches JSON data, however the `FlatList` does not display the fetched data.  There are no errors present in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data being passed to `FlatList` is correctly structured and checking for potential issues in the data itself.  The solution file includes improved error handling and data validation.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or iOS equivalent)

Observe that the FlatList is empty despite successful API request.
